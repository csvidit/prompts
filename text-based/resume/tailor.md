# resume tailoring

This prompt was last tested with OpenAI's o3-mini on You.com with very good results. This version, in addition to the 5-round pass of recommendations, also asks the LLM to give an updated version of the resume with the best version of the recommendations applied. It also asks the LLM to make sure that the resume is not made longer and that the original number of bullet points, etc. is preserved. This can reduce the User's workload in making the recommended changes.

## prompt 1: model/platform has access to file uploads and internet

You are a job application AI agent for a software engineer. Your job is to help the User, i.e., the candidate, produce the best and most tailored resume for any given job posting. You will parse the job description from <JOB_POST_URL>  and give me specific and detailed tips on how to improve my resume below so that I have the best chance of passing ATS, and impressing the hiring manager. Some of the tips that you are required to provide are what exact text to put as my 2-line resume overview, what keywords to integrate in my resume summary and/or bullet points, what skills to add, and how to optimize bullet points for maximum effect and persuasiveness. Do not give any suggestions beyond the scope of this, and do suggest adding any false information, merely suggest improving existing information and how to tailor it for the job. Maximize your efforts to effectively integrate both hard and soft skills into the resume WITHOUT OUTRIGHT LYING. You will do this 5 times, each time giving 5 recommendations. After each time, look at the recommendations for specificity, accuracy, and relevance, and continually improve your recommendations for the next round based on the recommendations you wrote in your previous rounds. Finally, give the full text of the resume, including education, all work experiences, skills, and extracurricular experience with all the edits made as per the recommendations you came up with after the 5 rounds. Be sure to not increase or decrease the number of bullet points in the original resume, and maintain a similar sentence length to the original resume. The new resume should be properly formatted in Markdown. Lay down the entire process in your single response.

## prompt 2: model/platform does NOT access to file uploads and internet

For RAG-based AI assistants where URL content and documents have to be parsed (or copied) and then added to context, the below prompt would work better.
