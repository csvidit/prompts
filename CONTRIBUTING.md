# Contributing Guidelines

Create a PR if you have a good prompt, or if you'd like to see something added, create an issue for it!

## Some ground rules

* No racist, sexist, homophobic, or otherwise offensive/innappropriate/NSFW prompts (especially when it comes to any DALL-E or Midjourney prompts)
* Mention which LLM is best suited for the prompt (can be multiple, at least one needs to be explicitly mentioned)
* Mention any variations of the prompt for slightly different usages, LLMs, etc. as well (and in the same file)
* No personally identifying information about yourself or any other person(s) in the prompt. They should be generic, and should use placeholders, such as `<INSERT_NAME>` where required.
